# Movie Dataset Menu Interface Application
The IMDB movie dataset hosted by Kaggle contains the details of over 5043 movies scraped from the IMDB movie website. The 
dataset attempted to collect 28 features describing each movie. 

The objective of this project is to produce an application and report that allows the user to explore some of the most interesting aspects of the 
IMDB dataset. Python was used in coding. Pandas and Numpy where the main packages used. Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn was used wherever necessary
