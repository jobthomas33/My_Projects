The objective of this  project was to analyze and select the best locations in the city of Kochi, India to open a new cafe. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question:In the city of Kochi, Kerala, India, if a property developer is looking to open a new caf√©, where
